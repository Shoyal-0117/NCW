**Legal Recourse for Outraging Modesty**

A woman who is aggrieved by an act that constitutes the offence of outraging her modesty has two primary legal options:

1.  **Filing an FIR:** She can file a First Information Report (FIR) at the local police station that has jurisdiction over the area where she resides or where the offence was committed.

2.  **Filing a Private Complaint:** As an alternative, she can directly file a private complaint under Section 210 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita before a Magistrate with jurisdiction. The Magistrate will examine the complaint and, if satisfied that a cognizable offence is disclosed, may take cognizance of the matter and proceed with the case.
