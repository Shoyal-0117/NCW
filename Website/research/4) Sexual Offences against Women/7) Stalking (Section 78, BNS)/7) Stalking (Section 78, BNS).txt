This section defines the offence of stalking. It essentially criminalizes the act of persistently following or attempting to contact a woman against her explicit wishes.

The offence primarily involves two types of behavior:

1.  Physically following a woman, or attempting to force communication with her, after she has clearly indicated her disinterest.
2.  Monitoring a woman's internet usage, emails, and other online activities without her consent.

Punishment:
- For the first type of stalking (physical following or unwanted contact), the punishment is imprisonment which may extend up to three years, and shall also be liable to a fine.
- For the second type (cyber-stalking), the punishment is more severe, with imprisonment which may extend up to five years, and shall also be liable to a fine.
