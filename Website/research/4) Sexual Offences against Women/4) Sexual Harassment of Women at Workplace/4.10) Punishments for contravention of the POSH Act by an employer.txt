If an employer fails to fulfill their obligations under the POSH Act, such as the failure to constitute an Internal Committee, or if they contravene, attempt to contravene, or abet the contravention of any other provision of the Act, they shall be punishable with a fine of fifty thousand rupees.

If an employer, after having been convicted for an offence, is subsequently found guilty of committing the same offence again, they shall be liable for a punishment that is twice the amount originally imposed. Furthermore, any business license required for carrying on their trade or activities may be revoked or cancelled.
