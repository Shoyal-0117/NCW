**Who Can File a Complaint**

A formal complaint of sexual harassment is typically filed by the aggrieved woman herself.

However, the law allows for other individuals to file a complaint on her behalf under specific circumstances:

*   **In case of physical incapacity:** If the woman is physically unable to file the complaint, it can be filed by her legal heir, relative, friend, co-worker, an officer of the National or State Commission for Women, or any other person who has knowledge of the incident.

*   **In case of mental incapacity:** If the woman is mentally unable to file the complaint, it can be filed by a person such as a relative, friend, special educator, guardian, qualified psychologist, or psychiatrist. This must be done jointly with any other person who has knowledge of the incident.
