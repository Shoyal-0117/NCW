**Complaint Procedure and Inquiry Process**

**1. Initiation and Response:**
*   Upon receiving a complaint, the Internal Committee (IC) or Local Committee (LC) must provide a copy to the respondent within seven days.
*   The respondent is required to file a written reply to the complaint, along with any supporting documents and a list of witnesses, within ten working days of receiving it.

**2. Conciliation:**
*   If the aggrieved woman requests a settlement, the IC or LC may attempt to facilitate conciliation between the parties. It is important to note that this settlement cannot be based on a monetary payment.
*   If a settlement is successfully reached, it is recorded in writing and the inquiry process is concluded.

**3. Inquiry:**
*   If no settlement is requested or if the conciliation attempt fails, the IC or LC must initiate a formal inquiry.
*   The inquiry is conducted in accordance with the organization's service rules or, if none exist, in a prescribed manner that adheres to the principles of natural justice.
*   The inquiry must be completed within a period of ninety days.
*   Legal practitioners are not permitted to represent either party during the proceedings before the IC or LC.

**4. Report:**
*   Upon completion, the committee prepares a detailed report of the inquiry along with its recommendations.
*   This report must be submitted to the employer (in the case of an IC) or the District Officer (in the case of an LC) within ten days. A copy of the report is also provided to both the concerned parties.
