The Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013, commonly known as the **POSH Act**, was enacted to safeguard women against sexual harassment at their place of work.

The primary objective of the Act is to ensure that women have access to a safe and secure working environment. To achieve this, the law mandates the establishment of a formal and structured internal mechanism for the redressal of complaints related to sexual harassment.
