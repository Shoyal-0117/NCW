**Constitution of an Internal Committee (IC)**

Every establishment employing ten or more workers is legally mandated to constitute an Internal Committee (IC). If an establishment has multiple offices or branches, each administrative unit must have its own IC.

**Composition Requirements for the Internal Committee:**

The Internal Committee must adhere to the following structure:

*   It must have a minimum of four members.
*   At least half (50%) of the total members must be women.
*   The presiding officer must be a senior-level woman employee working at the workplace.
*   At least two members must be from among the employees, preferably committed to the cause of women.
*   One external member must be included from an NGO or an association committed to the cause of women, or a person familiar with the issues relating to sexual harassment (such as a social worker or a person with a background in labour, service, civil, or criminal law).
*   The members shall hold office for a term not exceeding three years.
