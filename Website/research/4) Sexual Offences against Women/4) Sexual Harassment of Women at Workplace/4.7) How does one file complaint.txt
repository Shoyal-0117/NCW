**Procedure for Filing a Complaint**

A complaint of sexual harassment must be submitted in writing to either the Internal Committee (IC) or the Local Committee (LC). The complaint should be filed within three months from the date of the incident. In the case of a series of incidents, the three-month period is calculated from the date of the most recent occurrence.

**Other Key Requirements:**

*   The written complaint should be submitted in six copies.
*   It must be accompanied by any supporting documents and a list of the names and addresses of any witnesses.
*   If the aggrieved woman is unable to write the complaint, a member of the IC or LC is obligated to provide all necessary assistance to help her put the complaint in writing.
*   The three-month time limit for filing can be extended by the IC or LC for a further period of up to three months. This extension is granted upon a written request from the complainant that provides satisfactory reasons for the delay.
