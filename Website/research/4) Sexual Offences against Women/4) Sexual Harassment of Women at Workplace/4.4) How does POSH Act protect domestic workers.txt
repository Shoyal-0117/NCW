**Protection for Domestic Workers**

The safeguards provided by the POSH Act explicitly extend to domestic workers.

A **'domestic worker'** is defined as any woman employed to perform household work, either on a part-time or full-time basis. This includes women employed directly by a household or through an agency, and it covers both temporary and permanent workers.

In the event of sexual harassment, a domestic worker has the right to file a formal complaint with the **Local Committee**, which is the designated redressal body for her situation.
