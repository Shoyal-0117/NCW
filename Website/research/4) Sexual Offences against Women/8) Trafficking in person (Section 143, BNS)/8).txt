**Definition of Trafficking (Section 143(1))**

A person commits the offence of trafficking if they perform any of the following acts—recruit, transport, harbor, transfer, or receive a person—for the purpose of exploitation, by using any of the following means:

-   Threats
-   Force or any other form of coercion
-   Abduction
-   Fraud or deception
-   Abuse of power
-   Inducement, including giving or receiving payments or benefits to secure the consent of someone controlling the victim

**Explanation and Key Principle**

The term "exploitation" is comprehensively defined to include practices such as slavery, servitude, forced labor, and the forced removal of organs.

A critical principle established here is that the consent of the victim is irrelevant and does not serve as a defense for the perpetrator in a trafficking case.

**Punishment**

The punishments for trafficking and its various aggravated forms are detailed in subsequent sub-sections 143(2) through 143(7) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita. These provisions prescribe severe penalties for all aspects of the crime.
