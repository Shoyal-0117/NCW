This provision addresses the offence of voyeurism. A person is held guilty under this section if they watch, or capture images of, a woman engaged in a private act in circumstances where she would usually have the expectation of not being observed by the perpetrator or any other person. The offence also includes the dissemination of such captured images.

Punishment:
- For the act of capturing an image, the punishment is imprisonment for a term which may extend from one year to three years.
- If the perpetrator disseminates the image, the punishment is more severe, with imprisonment for a term which may extend from three years to seven years, and shall also be liable to a fine.
