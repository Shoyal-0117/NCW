The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has issued guidelines mandating that a standardized medico-legal kit be available in every hospital for the purpose of collecting DNA samples for forensic testing.

The medical report generated from this examination must contain the following details:

-   Name and address of the survivor
-   Age of the survivor
-   A description of the biological material collected for DNA testing
-   Observation and documentation of any physical injuries, if present
-   An assessment of the general mental condition of the survivor
