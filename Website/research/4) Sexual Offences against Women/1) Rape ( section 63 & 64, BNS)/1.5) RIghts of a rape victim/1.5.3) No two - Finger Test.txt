Prohibition of the "Two-Finger Test"

During a medical examination, a doctor is expressly prohibited from performing the "two-finger test."

The Supreme Court of India has ruled that this test violates a rape survivor's fundamental rights to privacy, mental integrity, and dignity. Therefore, conducting this test is illegal.

Section 184 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita outlines the proper procedure for preparing the medical report, specifying the details that must be included.

A doctor has no right to inquire about or investigate the past sexual activity of the victim, as it is irrelevant to the case and a violation of her rights.
