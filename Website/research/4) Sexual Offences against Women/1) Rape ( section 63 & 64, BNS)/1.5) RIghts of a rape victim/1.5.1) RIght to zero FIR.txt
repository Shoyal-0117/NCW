The term zero FIR means that the person can file an FIR in any police station, irrespective of the place of incident of the jurisdiction. The same FIR later should be transferred to the police station having jurisdiction for the investigation to begin.

For instance, let us suppose if a girl got raped by someone in West Bengal & didn't tell anyone about the incident & came to Delhi. Now, if she wants to file an FIR against that rapist, she can directly go to any police station in Delhi & can file an FIR against the person. The same FIR will be transferred by Delhi Police to west Bengal police. This concept is known as concept of zero FIR.
