Whenever a law governing maintenance is breached, a petition can be filed with a court of competent jurisdiction, and the petition will be decided on the merits of the case.

For example, if a husband refuses to maintain his wife, the wife may approach the Hon'ble Court for maintenance.

In a Domestic Violence case, prima facie evidence of Domestic Violence is required to obtain maintenance for the wife. All cases are handled on their own merits within the parameters of the law.
