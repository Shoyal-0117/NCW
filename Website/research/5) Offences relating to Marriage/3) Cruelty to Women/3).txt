Whoever, being the husband or a relative of the husband, subjects a woman to cruelty is punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years, and shall also be liable to a fine.

**Explanation of Cruelty:**

2.  Harassment of the woman, where such harassment is intended to coerce her or any person related to her to meet any unlawful demand for any property or valuable security, or is on account of her or her relative's failure to meet such a demand.
