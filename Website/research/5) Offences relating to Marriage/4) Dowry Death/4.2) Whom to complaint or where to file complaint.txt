**Procedure for Filing a Police Complaint**

You can initiate legal action through the following steps:

1.  **Lodge a Complaint:** You can make a written or oral complaint at the nearest police station.
2.  **Filing an FIR:** The police are required to register a First Information Report (FIR) based on your complaint.
3.  **Remedy for Refusal:** If the police officer refuses to register the FIR, you can escalate the complaint to the Superintendent of Police (SP) of the district, either in person or by post.
4.  **Approaching the Magistrate:** If the SP also does not take action, you can approach a Magistrate who can direct the police to register the FIR.
5.  **Filing a Writ Petition:** As a further legal remedy, you can file a writ petition in the High Court to compel the police to register the FIR.
6.  **Right to Copy:** You have the right to receive a free copy of the FIR.
