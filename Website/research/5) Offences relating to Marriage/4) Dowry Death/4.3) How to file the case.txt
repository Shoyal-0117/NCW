**Legal Procedure in a Dowry Death Case**

1.  **Investigation:** The police commence their investigation after the FIR is registered.

2.  **Trial:** A case under Section 80 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) is filed and tried in the Sessions Court.

3.  **Burden of Proof:**
    The prosecution must prove the following key elements:
    *   The death was caused by burns, bodily injury, or occurred in an unnatural manner. A post-mortem report is typically sufficient evidence for this.
    *   The death occurred within seven years of marriage. This can be established using evidence like a marriage certificate, wedding photographs, or invitation cards.
    *   The woman was harassed soon before her death, and this harassment was linked to a demand for dowry.

    If the prosecution successfully proves these aspects, the court shall presume that the husband or his relatives are responsible for the dowry death. The burden then shifts to the accused to prove their innocence.

    **Punishment:** The offence is punishable with imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than seven years, but which may extend to life imprisonment. It is a non-bailable and non-compoundable offence, meaning no bail as a right and no compromise is legally permissible.

4.  **Court Fees:** No court fee is required to be paid for filing such a case.
