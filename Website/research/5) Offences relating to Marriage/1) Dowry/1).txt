**Definition of Dowry**

Dowry refers to any property or valuable security—such as money, goods, jewelry, or assets—that is demanded or given by one party to a marriage to the other, directly or indirectly. This typically involves demands made by the husband's side from the wife's side in connection with the marriage. (Section 2, Dowry Prohibition Act)

**Interpretation of Dowry**

The legal interpretation of dowry includes any money, gift, or valuable security offered by the parents of either spouse, or by any other person, at or in relation to the marriage. This can encompass the transfer of parental assets, as well as specific items like vehicles, household appliances, jewelry, or cash.

**Distinction from Mehr**

It is important to distinguish dowry from Mehr. Under Sharia law, Mehr is a mandatory financial commitment made by the groom to the bride herself, as a mark of respect and security. It is not considered a dowry, which is a payment from the bride's family to the groom's side.
