**Monetary Reliefs and Compensation**

In addition to other forms of relief, the Magistrate may, upon an application filed by the aggrieved woman, pass an order directing the respondent to pay monetary relief. This relief is intended as compensation and damages for the injuries suffered by the woman, which include not only physical harm but also mental torture and emotional distress caused by the acts of domestic violence.
