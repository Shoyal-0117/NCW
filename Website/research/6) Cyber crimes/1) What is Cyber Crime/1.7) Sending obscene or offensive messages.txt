Cybercrime against women includes sending offensive messages via WhatsApp, mail, or any other social media site. When an offence does not qualify as a crime under the Information Technology Act, women usually turn to the Indian Penal Code’s sections 354A for sexual harassment, 354 for outraging women’s modesty, 499 for defamation, and 509 for insulting women’s modesty.
