**Essential Cybersecurity and Social Media Safety Practices**

Protect your digital presence with the same vigilance you use to protect yourself in the physical world. Here are key steps to ensure your safety online:

**Social Media & Privacy Settings:**
*   **Manage Privacy:** Select strict privacy and content-sharing filters on your social media accounts. This ensures you share information, photos, and videos only with people you trust.
*   **Control Your Network:** Be selective about accepting friend requests from strangers. Learn how to block users who make you uncomfortable or remove them from your friends list.
*   **Secure Access:** Always log out from social media websites after use, especially on shared devices.
*   **Beware of Fakes:** Remember that not all social media accounts are genuine. Be skeptical of information provided on profiles. If you discover a fake account impersonating you, report it immediately to the social media platform to have it blocked.

**Device & Data Security:**
*   **Lock Devices:** Secure your phone and other devices with a strong password, PIN, pattern, or biometric lock.
*   **Disable Location:** Turn off location services for social media apps and other non-essential applications.
*   **Sensitive Media:** Avoid using your smartphone for sensitive personal photographs and videos. Remember that connected devices often automatically save media to cloud storage, from which it can be recovered even if deleted from the phone.
*   **App Safety:** Only install applications from trusted sources like official app stores (e.g., Play Store, App Store) or official company websites.

**Online Interactions & Browsing:**
*   **Guard Personal Information:** Refrain from sharing personal details like your phone number, email address, or photographs with unknown persons online.
*   **Video Call Caution:** Be mindful of your appearance and surroundings during video chats, as the person on the other side could be recording without your knowledge.
*   **Safe Browsing:** Conduct sensitive activities like online banking or shopping only on your personal devices and trusted networks. Avoid using public computers, free Wi-Fi, or a friend's phone for such tasks, as your data can be stolen.
*   **Data Permanence:** Understand that deleted data from your devices can often be recovered.

**Seeking Help & Reporting:**
*   **Consult Trusted Contacts:** If you believe you are a victim of cyberstalking, consult your relatives or friends for support.
*   **Report Illegal Content:** Immediately report any content related to Child Pornography/Child Sexual Abuse Material (CP/CSAM) or other sexually explicit material to the concerned social media website and authorities.
