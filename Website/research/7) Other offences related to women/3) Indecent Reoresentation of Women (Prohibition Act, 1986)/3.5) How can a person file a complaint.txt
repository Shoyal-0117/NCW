**Filing a Complaint**

Any person who believes that an offence under this Act has been committed by an individual or a company can file a First Information Report (FIR) with the police against the concerned party.

It is important to note that an FIR for an offence under this Act is typically filed alongside charges under **Sections 292 and 293 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC)**, which deal specifically with the offence of 'obscenity'.
