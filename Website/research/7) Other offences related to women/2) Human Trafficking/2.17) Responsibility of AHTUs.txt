**Role of Anti-Human Trafficking Units (AHTUs)**

Anti-Human Trafficking Units (AHTUs) are specialized police units established with the following key objectives and functions:

*   **Focused & Multidisciplinary Approach:** To ensure concentrated attention on human trafficking cases and foster a coordinated, joint response from all relevant stakeholders.
*   **Organized Crime Perspective:** To address trafficking crimes with the understanding that they are often part of larger, organized criminal networks.
*   **Inter-Departmental Collaboration:** To promote seamless collaboration between the police and other government departments, such as Women and Child Development, Labour, and Health.
*   **Rescue Operations:** To conduct rescue operations upon receiving information about trafficking activities from police sources, NGOs, or civil society, often in partnership with non-governmental organizations.
*   **Victim-Centric Protocol:** To implement a victim-centric approach that prioritizes the 'best interest of the survivor,' prevents secondary victimization, and ensures gender-sensitive and child rights-sensitive handling of all cases.
*   **Data Collection & Management:** To act as a grassroots unit for collecting and developing a comprehensive database on all law enforcement aspects of trafficking. This includes intelligence on traffickers and gangs, which is shared with District, State, and the National Crime Records Bureau to build a robust national-level database on this crime.
