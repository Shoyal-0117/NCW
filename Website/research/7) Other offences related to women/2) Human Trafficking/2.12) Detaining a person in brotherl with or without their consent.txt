If any person detains another person in a brothel or any other premises with the intention to facilitate prostitution, whether with or without their consent, such person shall be punishable with imprisonment of a minimum of seven years, extendable to life imprisonment. Further, the ITPA provides that if a person withholds any jewellery, money or property from a woman or a girl or withholds her from wearing apparel or threatens her with legal proceedings if she takes away with her any jewellery, apparel, money or property lent to her by such person, then it shall be presumed that such person has detained the woman or girl.
