**Key Points of the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)**

The Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Anti-Human Trafficking Units (AHTUs) outlines the following crucial measures:

*   **Investigation Focus:** AHTUs are mandated to thoroughly investigate trafficking cases with a special emphasis on dismantling organized crime networks. This includes targeting the financial infrastructure of crime syndicates through actions like sealing, attaching, and confiscating property.
*   **Rescue Team Composition:** Rescue operations must be conducted by a multi-disciplinary team. This team should include representatives from the Police, the Labour Department, a Sub-Divisional Magistrate (SDM) or their representative, a representative from an NGO or the complainant, a lady police officer or volunteer, and a member of the Child Welfare Committee.
*   **Child Repatriation:** The swift and safe repatriation of rescued children is a primary objective. Before repatriation, a home verification inquiry must be conducted as per the Juvenile Justice Act. The Child Welfare Committee in the child's home district is then responsible for their long-term well-being.
*   **Legal Process:** The victim's statement must be formally recorded under Section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC). The charge sheet should be filed promptly after the investigation is complete.
*   **Financial Rehabilitation:** The Labour Department is to initiate proceedings for the immediate recovery of a fine of ₹20,000 from the offender. This amount is to be directed to the Rehabilitation Cum Welfare Society of Child Labour in the child's native district to fund their socio-economic and educational rehabilitation.
