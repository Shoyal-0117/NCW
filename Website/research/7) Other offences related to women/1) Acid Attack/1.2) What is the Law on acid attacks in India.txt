**Legislation and Punishment for Acid Attacks**

**Governing Laws:**
-   The offence was previously governed by Sections 326A and 326B of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).
-   It is now addressed under **Section 124 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), 2023**.

**Punishment under BNS:**

1.  **For Causing Hurt:** Whoever causes permanent or partial damage, deformity, burns, maiming, disfigurement, disability, or grievous hurt by using acid shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than ten years, but which may extend to imprisonment for life, and shall also be liable to fine.
    *   Importantly, the fine imposed is to be paid to the victim to cover her medical expenses.

2.  **For Attempt:** Whoever throws or attempts to throw acid on any person, or attempts to administer acid, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than five years, but which may extend to seven years, and shall also be liable to fine.

**Punishment for Denial of Treatment:**
-   The law also prescribes punishment for any public or private hospital that denies treatment to an acid attack victim.
-   Denial of treatment is punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to one year, or with a fine, or with both. (Section 200, BNS)
-   Provisions also exist for penalizing police officers who refuse to register an FIR or record evidence.
