**Offence of Acid Attacks (Section 124, BNS)**

This section criminalizes acts involving acid that cause severe harm. The offence is established if an act results in:

*   Permanent or partial damage, deformity, burns, maiming, disfigurement, or disability to any part of a person's body; or
*   Grievous hurt caused by throwing acid, administering acid, or by using any other means with a similar effect.

A crucial element of the offence is that it must be committed with the intention to cause such injury, or with the knowledge that such injury is likely to be caused.

**Why it is Classified as an Offence Relating to Women**

While the law itself is gender-neutral, this offence is categorized under "offences relating to women" because a vast majority of acid attack victims are women. These attacks are often perpetrated against women who reject proposals, refuse relationships, or disagree with the demands of the perpetrator.
