**Section 124: Voluntarily Causing Grievous Hurt by Acid Attack**

This section specifically addresses the offence of causing grievous hurt through the use of acid. It establishes two primary conditions for the offence:

1.  A person commits an offence if they cause permanent or partial damage, deformity, burns, maiming, disfigurement, disability, or grievous hurt to any part of another person's body. This is committed by:
    *   Throwing acid on a person,
    *   Administering acid to a person, or
    *   Using any other means with the same effect,
    and does so with the intention of causing such injury, or with the knowledge that such injury is likely to be caused.

2.  A person also commits an offence if they *attempt* to throw or administer acid, or attempt to use any other means, with the intention of causing such permanent or partial damage, deformity, burns, maiming, disfigurement, disability, grievous hurt, or of causing a person to be in a permanent vegetative state. The mere attempt is punishable under this section.
