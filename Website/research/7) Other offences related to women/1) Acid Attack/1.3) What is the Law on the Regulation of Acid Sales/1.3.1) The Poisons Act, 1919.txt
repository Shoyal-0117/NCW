**Regulation of Acid Sales**

In a significant move in 2013, the Supreme Court of India took proactive notice of the rising incidents of acid attacks. The Court passed a specific order to regulate and monitor the sale of corrosive substances across the country.

Following this judicial directive, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) issued a detailed advisory to all State Governments. This advisory was based on the **Model Poisons Possession and Sale Rules, 2013**, which were framed under the authority of **The Poisons Act, 1919**. These rules provide a framework for states to control and oversee the possession and sale of acids and other corrosive substances.
